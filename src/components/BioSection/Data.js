      'A full stack web developer fresh to the game. Based out of the Twin Cities, I am a proud husband and dog daddy. I love traveling, hiking, live music, eating exotic food, and being creative. Whether its music, photography, videography, or even just a delicious meal, I love putting my own personal touch on everythng I do. Growing up, I always had a passion for art, design, and technology. After spending far too long working in concrete construction, Iâ€™m ready to dive deep into the software development industry and start expanding my horizons into something new. Thank you for checking out my portfolio page. If you would like to see more click the Github link at the bottom of the page or stay tuned because there is always more to come!',
