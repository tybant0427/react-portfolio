      'Im Tyler, a full stack web developer fresh to the game. Based out of the Twin Cities and a proud husband and dog daddy. I love traveling, seeing live music, eating exotic food, snowboarding, and creating things. Wether its music, photography, videos, or even just a delicious meal.. Growing up, I always had a passion for art, design, and technology. After spending way to long in concrete construction, Iâ€™m ready to start expanding my horizons to something new. Thanks for checking out my portfolio, more to come!',
