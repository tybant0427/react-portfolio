# My React Portfolio! 

## Description 
Welcome to my react portfolio! Here you can see an about section, a project section, and a contact section. The project section has both options to either view the deployed application, or the github repo for each project. If you scroll down further you can see the footer/contact section. Here there is an email link you can click to email me directly, along with github and linkedin icons that are clickable, to bring you to all my content. To navigate throughout the page I have a hamburger menu in the navbar that opens a nav menu. The nav bar also renders no matter what webpage you are on. 

## Future Development 
* Would like to have a more in-depth project section that displays my group projects and single projects apart. 
* A contact form somewhere. 
* Better responsiveness. 

## Tech Used 
* React 
* React Router 
* React Icons 
* Styled Components (CSS)
* HTML
* JavaScript
